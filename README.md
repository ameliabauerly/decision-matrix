## How to Use

### Step 1: Define Criteria
- Add decision criteria (e.g., "Cost", "Quality", "Location")
- Assign weights to each criterion (percentages that should total 100%)
- Edit or remove criteria as needed

### Step 2: Define Alternatives
- Add up to 3 alternatives to compare
- Give each alternative a descriptive name
- Edit or remove alternatives as needed

### Step 3: Score Alternatives
- Rate each alternative against each criterion using a 1-5 scale:
  - 1 = Poor
  - 2 = Below Average
  - 3 = Average
  - 4 = Good
  - 5 = Excellent
- All scores must be completed before proceeding

### Step 4: View Results
- See ranked results with the best alternative highlighted
- View detailed scoring breakdown
- Export results to PDF for record-keeping
- Start a new decision matrix
